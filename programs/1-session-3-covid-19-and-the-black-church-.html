                   <p>&nbsp;</p>
                   <h4>Time: 10:55 AM - 11:40 AM, November 18</h4>
                   <p>Background and Objective: Of the many 2020 lessons, relying on academic–community research partnerships helped to facilitate community engagement and encourage life-saving health behaviors.  Involving Black Faith-Based Institutions as community partners in public health interventions has traditionally been successful in promoting positive health behaviors.  The scientific literature, unfortunately, lacked a clear roadmap for pandemic-related public health behaviors and operational transformations with Black Faith-Based Institutions.  In order to build productive collaboration with Black Churches, researchers need to understand what is already happening. Therefore, the present study follows two objectives: (1) to examine the content, kind, and type of health information currently shared in Black faith-based institutions and (2) to evaluate and discuss the accuracy of that information with representatives of faith-based institutions.
Methodology: A qualitative content analysis of available social media. The study sample included 10 churches from the Capital Region and 10 churches from New York City. Each church was randomly selected from a list of Black Churches in New York State by region. The data collection instrument was designed to capture the social media and sermon content. In addition, common pandemic health behaviors were recorded. 
Preliminary Findings: The findings indicate that Black Churches across two regions of New York State were differentially prepared to support their congregations. Some churches social media included pandemic health behavior content that resembled information available from a public health department. For example, some social media was exclusively dedicated to coronavirus resources that were easily accessible. Other churches were not similarly prepared to distribute health behavior content as readily. The social media content, in general, reflected basic health information for those churches who were social media savvy. The service recordings showed many pastors alone in their church or home offices. The videos indicated early demonstration of social distancing.  For churches that did not have a social media presence it is unknown the kind of messaging in sermon or public health practice that was passed on to congregants. 
Preliminary Summary: The Black Church throughout responses to the pandemic provided spiritual uplift, encouragement and addressed family shortages. There was evidence that many churches provided food, clothing, masks, hand sanitizer, disinfectant, and communal prayer to all who needed it (both church and community members). Many churches found a way to virtually support congregants through prayer and remain a steadfast, trusted resource within the Black community. Given the spread of COVID-19 and social distancing mandates, churches have relied on many ways to remain in contact with its members in order to pass on information, spiritual and emotional support. The coronavirus pandemic has encouraged churches to explore innovative forms of communication to share messages of comfort with their congregants. Despite the shift from in person to online communications, the Black Church remains a beacon of hope and a source of strength for congregants and community members alike.</p><tr><td><div class = "speakers">
