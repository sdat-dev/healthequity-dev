                    <h2>The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Related Stressors on Graduate and Undergraduate Students at a Majority-Minority University in NYS</h2>
                   <p>&nbsp;</p>
                   <h4>Time: 9:15 AM - 10:00 AM, November 18</h4>
                   <p>Introduction. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has greatly compromised the life experiences of US college students. Recent studies have shown that college students have experienced a series of challenges in general well-being (Copeland et al. 2021) and academic functioning due to the transition to online learning (Kyne and Thompson 2020). What’s more, students of historically marginalized identities have experienced a “double pandemic” due to the disproportionate dual impact of Covid-19 on physical health and mental health, evidenced by the elevated mortality rates in Black and Hispanic individuals (Cheng, Sun, and Monnat 2020), the mental exhaustion resulted from a series of societal upheavals (e.g., the 2020 presidential election, the murder of George Floyd, the increase in Anti-Asian hate crimes), the loss of LGBTQ+ identity celebration and activism (Pereira et al. 2021), and the resulting loss of appeal for international students to study in the US (Berger 2021).  

Method. Qualitative data were gathered through seven focus groups conducted in mid-December from 30 public university graduate and undergraduate students. The participants represented a diverse range of race/ethnicity (56.7% White), gender (70% cisgender women, 20% cisgender men, 10% transgender or nonbinary), and sexual orientation (53.5% heterosexual or straight). The focus group questions protocol was developed by an interdisciplinary team, and all focus groups were transcribed and further checked for accuracy. Three members of the research team with expertise in qualitative analysis performed thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke 2006, 86-93) to generate themes across the data, and review discrepancies before finally reaching consensus.  

Results. The process of thematic analysis has produced three common themes from the data. (1) Worries related to health: Participants expressed concerns about the health of family members as well as eagerness for more clarity and enforcement of public health guidelines on campus. (2) Sociopolitical anxiety: Participants reported ongoing difficulty balancing academic responsibilities while dealing with ongoing anxiety and stress related to the sociopolitical climate. Specifically, participants felt “inescapable” from stress due to constant exposure on social media, television, and daily conversations with close others regarding the political climate and presidential election. For students with historically marginalized identities (i.e., international students, transgender and nonbinary students, racial minority students), some reported that “it’s a literal matter of survival.” (3) Challenging adjustment beyond remote learning: Participants reported challenges associated with remote learning, as they experienced difficulty meeting the demands of their multiple roles and competing responsibilities, as they were “being pulled in 30 directions.” Participants also expressed significant loss of connections with peers and professors, as if it is “all of the work with none of the fun.” 

Discussion. The current sociopolitical context exacerbated ongoing stressors for both undergraduate and graduate students, particularly BIPOC, LGBTQ+, and international students, many of whom were experiencing a “double pandemic.” As we move toward a post-pandemic society, this work will hold critical implications for higher education institutions in New York State as well as nationally and globally and will provide valuable and timely guidance regarding steps that may be implemented at the individual, academic, administrative, and policy levels.</p><tr><td><div class = "speakers">
