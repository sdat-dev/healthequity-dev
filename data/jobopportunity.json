While all outstanding scholars focused on health disparities are encouraged to apply, the successful candidate will have significant experience leading research that addresses minority health inequality, minority health, or social equity, which could include the physical/built environment, the sociocultural environment, biological and behavioral health, the social determinants of health, and epigenetics, along with other related areas.
