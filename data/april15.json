She is a past president of the American Public Health Association, a senior fellow at the Morehouse School of Medicine, and an adjunct professor at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University."},{"type":"p","content":"Racism is a system of structuring opportunity and assigning value based on the social interpretation of how one looks (which is what we call “race”), which unfairly disadvantages some individuals and communities, unfairly advantages other individuals and communities, and saps the strength of the whole society through the waste of human resources. While at Radcliffe, Jones is developing tools to inspire, equip, and engage all Americans in a national campaign against racism. For example, her allegories on “race” and racism illuminate topics that are otherwise difficult for many Americans to understand or discuss. Her toolbox will equip both children and adults to name racism, ask “How is racism operating here?” and organize and strategize to act."},{"type":"p","content":"Jones earned her BA in molecular biology from Wellesley College, her MD from the Stanford School of Medicine, and both her master of public health and her PhD in epidemiology from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. She also completed residency training in general preventive medicine at Johns Hopkins and in family medicine at the Residency Program in Social Medicine at Montefiore Medical Center."}]
