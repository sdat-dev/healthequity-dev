The actin protein polymerizes to form dynamic filaments that are central to the organization and remodeling of all eukaryotic cells. Our investigations into actin regulation employ a powerful model organism, the common bread/beer budding yeast called Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The proteins we study are conserved in structure and function thereby allowing us to use powerful tools to unravel their functions with biochemistry, cell biology,''genetic, structural biology and molecular biology techniques.","Registered":"","Role":"Panelist","Day":"1/22/2021","StartTime":0.4166666666666667,"EndTime":0.4791666666666667,"Type":"Plenary","Session":"Closing Panel","SessionTitle":"Reflecting on a campus-community integrated health equity research agenda","SessionLink":"closing_panel","Video":"https://youtu.be/IRY5WW9ABZs","PanelDescription":"The last session will re-engage participants in a joint discussion focused on the most critical health equity research questions and related public policy challenges.\r\nSmall Group 1 A: Pamela Straker (SUNY Downstate)\r\nSmall Group 1 B: Tonya Taylor (SUNY Downstate)\r\nSmall Group 1 C: Jeanette Altarriba (UAlbany)\r\nSmall Group 2 : Ayesha Joshi/Jack DeHovitz (SUNY Downstate)\r\nSmall Group 3 : Rukhsana Ahmed (UAlbany)\r\nSmall Group 4 A: Cristina Pope (SUNY Upstate)\r\nSmall Group 4 B: Lynn Warner (UAlbany)\r\nSmall Group 5 : Tracey Wilson/Chanee Massiah (SUNY Downstate)\r\nSmall Group 6 : Meghan Cook/Charles Welge (UAlbany/Albany Health Department)","HeaderImage":"header13.png","Summary":""},{"FirstName":"David","LastName":"Christini","DegreeCredential":"Ph.D.","InvitationStatus":"","Email":"David.Christini@downstate.edu","JobTitle":"Senior Vice President for Research","Department":"","Organization":"SUNY Downstate","Photo":"chistini.jpg","Bio":"Dr. Christini, a Professor of Physiology and Pharmacology, is the author of nearly a hundred peer-reviewed publications and has four issued US patents. He has been continuously funded by the NIH since 2004 and has also received funding from the NSF, the American Heart Association, and various foundations and organizations. He served as the Program Director on two NIH-funded training grants. He has served on multiple NIH and NSF review panels, serves as Associate Editor for Frontiers in Physiology, has served as a referee for more than 30 professional journals, and was elected as the co-Chair of the 2021 Gordon Conference on Cardiac Arrhythmia Mechanisms.\r\n\r\nHis research group is focused on improving the understanding of, and therapies for, cardiac arrhythmias. They primarily investigate biophysical mechanisms of electrophysiological instabilities and arrhythmia onset, from the subcellular to organ level. Because of the complexity of electrophysiological dynamics (both temporal and spatiotemporal), the team uses a multiscale approach that bridges the gap between physics and biology. Their experiments employ electrophysiological and imaging modalities, primarily at the cellular and tissue levels; they then use the experimental data to inform computational cardiac modeling that scales up from the single cell to the whole organ.\r\n\r\nPrior to joining Downstate in June 2020, Dr. Christini was a tenured Professor at Weill Cornell Medical College. At Weill Cornell, he was Vice Dean of the Weill Cornell Graduate School. He also served as Director of the Tri-Institutional PhD Program in Computational Biology & Medicine from its founding in 2003 until 2019, Assistant Dean of Scientific Computing, Vice Chair of Basic Research in the Department of Medicine, and Director of Basic Cardiovascular Research.\r\n\r\nDr. Christini holds a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Pennsylvania State University and both his Masters and Doctoral degrees in Biomedical Engineering from Boston University.\r\n\r\nFrom explorations focused on the development of new treatments and therapeutics to faculty and student-led research driving groundbreaking innovations in health and medicine, Dr. Christini is charged with developing, supporting, and driving strategic research programs at Downstate across a broad spectrum of interests from the basic sciences, to translational research, to clinical trials, to population research and health equity.","Registered":"","Role":"Panelist","Day":"1/22/2021","StartTime":0.4166666666666667,"EndTime":0.4791666666666667,"Type":"Plenary","Session":"Closing Panel","SessionTitle":"Reflecting on a campus-community integrated health equity research agenda","SessionLink":"closing_panel","Video":"https://youtu.be/IRY5WW9ABZs","PanelDescription":"The last session will re-engage participants in a joint discussion focused on the most critical health equity research questions and related public policy challenges.\r\nSmall Group 1 A: Pamela Straker (SUNY Downstate)\r\nSmall Group 1 B: Tonya Taylor (SUNY Downstate)\r\nSmall Group 1 C: Jeanette Altarriba (UAlbany)\r\nSmall Group 2 : Ayesha Joshi/Jack DeHovitz (SUNY Downstate)\r\nSmall Group 3 : Rukhsana Ahmed (UAlbany)\r\nSmall Group 4 A: Cristina Pope (SUNY Upstate)\r\nSmall Group 4 B: Lynn Warner (UAlbany)\r\nSmall Group 5 : Tracey Wilson/Chanee Massiah (SUNY Downstate)\r\nSmall Group 6 : Meghan Cook/Charles Welge (UAlbany/Albany Health Department)","HeaderImage":"header14.png","Summary":""},{"FirstName":"Theresa","LastName":"Pardo","DegreeCredential":"MS PhD","InvitationStatus":"","Email":"tpardo@ctg.albany.edu","JobTitle":"Special Assistant to the President/Director, Center for Technology in Government (CTG UAlbany)","Department":"Full Research Professor, Public Administration and Policy","Organization":"University At Albany","Photo":"PARDO_THERESA_A.PNG","Bio":"Dr. Theresa A.
