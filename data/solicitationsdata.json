The purpose of this new program is to support the implementation of existing action plans that apply data-driven policy and innovative systems strategies to reduce infant mortality (IM) disparities in a specific county/jurisdiction. For the purposes of this NOFO, since &ldquo;county&rdquo; is not a term used for all geographic areas, the term &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; is also used and refers to tribal areas; the District of Columbia; municipalities within Puerto Rico; and similar geographical areas found within the US-affiliated Pacific Islands and Freely Associated States. The goals of the Catalyst for Infant Health Equity program are twofold: 1) to continue reducing overall IM rates in the United States, and 2) to decrease and ultimately eliminate disparities in IM across racial/ethnic groups by achieving steeper declines for groups with the highest rates. To accelerate disparity reduction, this project seeks to move beyond direct services to implementing targeted policy and systems interventions that will focus on one or more specific social determinants of health (SDOH) domains that contribute to IM disparities in a particular county/jurisdiction.","id":"108495","spon_name":"Maternal and Child Health Bureau/HRSA/DHHS","NextDeadlineDate":"19-Apr-2022","total_funding_limit":2500000,"programurl":null,"sponsor_type":"US Federal","prog_title":"Catalyst for Infant Health Equity","revision_date":"20-Jan-2022","deadline_note":null,"sponwebsite":"","deadline_date":"","contact":"","contact_tel":"","contact_email":""},{"synopsis":"There is one (1) award annually for $2,000 for graduate student research in health psychology for this category.&nbsp;&nbsp;","id":"087141","spon_name":"American Psychological Association","NextDeadlineDate":null,"total_funding_limit":2000,"programurl":"https://societyforhealthpsychology.org/councils-committees/student-council/graduate-student-research-awards-addressing-health-disparities/","sponsor_type":"Professional/Academic Assoc &amp; Soc.","prog_title":"Society for Health Psychology (Division 38) -- Graduate Student Research Awards Program  -- Research Addressing Health Disparities","revision_date":"04-Jan-2022","deadline_note":"Proposals will be reviewed on an annual basis and must be received by January 15, with notification of award made in late March.","sponwebsite":"","deadline_date":"","contact":"","contact_tel":"","contact_email":""},{"synopsis":"<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:medium;color:#000000;\">The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)</span><span style=\"font-size:medium;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;color:#000000;\"> is issuing a call for proposals to fund projects that will help eliminate health inequities in New Jersey as a next step to a policy report released earlier this year.</span><span style=\"font-size:11.5pt;font-family:'Helvetica',sans-serif;color:#443B3B;\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:medium;color:#000000;\">\"</span><a href=\"http://click.rwjfmail.org/?qs=c1767fac4e213fef2c15df8f147e635b3c616c861631dbe7123a2006857109d526e47a932b086305206c0def5a390c1e34206bbe9d82129c\" shape=\"rect\" style=\"font-size:inherit;\" data-analytics-content-id=\"00055426\"><span style=\"color:#000000;text-decoration:none;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:medium;\">Building a Culture of Health: A Policy Roadmap to Help All New Jerseyans Live Their Healthiest Lives </span></a><span style=\"font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:medium;color:#000000;\">\" with Rutgers University identifies 13 policy priorities in the state that will ensure everyone has a fair and just opportunity for health and well-being regardless of race, income, gender, and geography among other factors.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"font-size:11.5pt;font-family:'Helvetica',sans-serif;color:#443B3B;\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:medium;color:#000000;\"></span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:medium;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;color:#000000;\">RWJF is interested in engaging a diverse set of organizations across New Jersey to advance the policy options recommended in the RWJF/Rutgers report. </span><span style=\"font-size:medium;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;color:#000000;\">Policy/advocacy organizations, coalitions and partnerships with experience in policy advocacy, strategic communications, stakeholder engagement and coalition building are invited to submit proposals to lay the groundwork toward statewide policy change.

Reasons contributing to drowning risks among certain populations are multifaceted and likely related to access and exposure to water, knowledge and skills around water, and behaviors and beliefs. Research evaluating both structural and/or systemic forces which contribute to disparities in drowning risk among children, parents and communities is needed. Development of effective interventions aimed at addressing these factors as they pertain to drowning prevention is critical.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><em>Domain 2: Studying the effects of swim instruction on swim skills to prevent drowning.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">Swim skills, which are often obtained through swim instruction, can decrease drowning risk; however tremendous variability among types and techniques of swim instruction exists. Validated measures which consistently assess swim skill efficacy to prevent drowning at differing ages and developmental abilities are lacking. Metrics which help to identify effective, quality swim instruction to prevent drowning are needed. The development of evidence-based best practices as to when and how to instruct populations most at risk for drowning (such as children of young age, of certain races/ethnicities, with intellectual or developmental disabilities, or those with linguistic or cultural differences), is essential.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><em>Domain 3: The adoption, integration and sustainable scale-up of the drowning chain of survival.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">The five steps of drowning chain of survival can reduce drowning mortality. These steps include: (1) preventing drowning, (2) recognizing distress, (3) providing flotation, (4) removal from water and (5) providing care as needed. Depending on the water source, interventions which constitute these layers of drowning protection exist.

The recent global outbreak of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is not an anomaly and will most likely not be the last virus occurrence. Today, infectious diseases are emerging and reemerging more quickly than ever before. In the last four-five years alone, two viral infections, one caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV) and the other caused by a SARS-CoV-2 (Covid19), have spread world-wide, resulting in death, severe disease with yet, unknown, long-term morbidities., or severe birth defects to the new-born. Both ZIKV and SARS-CoV-2 infections may affect male and/or female reproductive systems in addition to other non-reproductive sites.
