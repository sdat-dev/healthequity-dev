We work toward eliminating health disparities by developing capacity in faculty at the University at Albany and partnering with community groups to identify their health concerns and the sources of disparities, and then plan, implement and test strategies to alleviate them. CEMHD is a partnership among community groups, hospitals, state and county health departments, the State of New York and the University at Albany."},{"type":"p","content":""},{"type":"a","content":"Brooklyn Health Disparities Center","source":"http://www.bhdc.nyc/"},{"type":"p","content":"The Brooklyn Health Disparities Center, a novel partnership, was formed in 2004 and included an academic research institution (SUNY - Downstate Medical Center), a community-based organization (Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health), and a government agency (Office of the Brooklyn Borough President).  The partnership was committed to reducing health disparities in Brooklyn and increasing the level of engagement of academics, community members, and policy makers in the process.
