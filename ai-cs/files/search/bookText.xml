The University at Albany (UAlbany)
is a comprehensive Research 1 (R1) institution under the Carnegie Classification and one of four research- focused “University Centers” in the State University of New York system. UAlbany is widely recognized for its cutting-edge research programs, student-centered academic and research experiences, and opportunities for research collaboration and industry partnership. UAlbany has
a demonstrated history of service to New York’s Capital Region and has been recognized by the Carnegie Foundation’s Community Engagement Classification.
UAlbany offers significant expertise in two rapidly growing and closely related research areas: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cybersecurity (CS). AI technologies automate many tasks traditionally performed by humans, such as image
or speech recognition, robot-assisted surgery, analysis of large data sets, and simulations of complex social problems. Cybersecurity is a rapidly evolving field dedicated to protecting information
systems from intrusion, disruption, or damage by bad actors.
Our AI and CS faculty work across a wide range of disciplines and departments, including Computer Science, Information Security, Mathematics, Electrical Engineering, and Emergency Preparedness. Their research projects are supported by grants from the Department of Defense, the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Justice, the Department of Energy, Global 500 corporations, and private foundations. We hope that you
will be inspired by the many research opportunities available to our students and research partners.
